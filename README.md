# dim-filters

### All of the below queries keep
- Crafted
- Deepsight pattern weapons
- Exotics
- High stat roll armor (using DIMs stat:custom setting)
- Class items with 6 or more energy power
- One of each weapon

IMPORTANT 
- Run a filter to find -is:maxpower and mark off 1 of each category
- Run the [tag-keep] filters BEFORE the [tag-junk]

[tag-keep] all the below
- [mec-keep-armor-hunter.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecster09/dim-filters/main/mec-keep-armor-hunter.txt)
- [mec-keep-weapon-primary.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecster09/dim-filters/main/mec-keep-weapons-primary.txt)
- [mec-keep-weapon-special.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecster09/dim-filters/main/mec-keep-weapons-special.txt)
- [mec-keep-weapon-heavy.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecster09/dim-filters/main/mec-keep-weapons-heavy.txt)

(NOTE: if you are manually runnning a filter you can use the combined filter [mec-keep-weapons.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecster09/dim-filters/main/mec-keep-weapons.txt) instead of the 3 below)

[tag:junk] all the below
- [mec-junk-armor-hunter.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecster09/dim-filters/main/mec-junk-armor-hunter.txt)
- [mec-junk-weapon-dupes.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecster09/dim-filters/main/mec-junk-weapon-dupes.txt)

If you want to remove all junk weapons including non-dupes then run this filter also
- [mec-junk-weapon.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecster09/dim-filters/main/mec-junk-weapon.txt)

- Armor is just for Hunter (as I only play one character!)
- This is my roll preference and also utilises the DIM wishlist.
